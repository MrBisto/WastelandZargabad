Changes from the standard 404, 2.8a build: 

IED's.

Jump-forward roll-Dive which ever fits it best im not sure, if you press "2" you will dive forward and roll over 
things in your way, this has been limited to not allow entry over objects used for base building unless you can all 
ready cler said item with volt key. but does allow for clearing of gaps between roofs. 
(not perfect and need to sort multiplayer animation to work still.)

Fast rope from heli's. (currently only Bhawks that spawn on server reset but fix soon hopefully).

OCUK's NO TWS script.

MaRkers Cargo Drop mission.

Scrumbees's other outpost missions.

Kettlewells Mission marker system and a Alpha of the new mission system by Kettlewell. 
(this includes reward for mission completion in random financial rewards to players within a radius and 
faster mission spawns).

Kettlewell's Supplies mission. (food and water trucks).

more guns and ammo in stores.

more/different vehicle types in missions.

simple skin changes: all teams have consistent pretty distinct camo skins.

all players no matter team start with a glock.

New vehicles, Static guns and Building materials added.

Loot now spawns in random buildings. (weapons ad items).

All wells can give water.

Gathering water from wells or pumps has an animation.

Fuel station's fixed. (as Taki... pumps couldn't fill jerry's.)

Filling a jerry can has an animation.

You can select to unflip flipped vehicles.
